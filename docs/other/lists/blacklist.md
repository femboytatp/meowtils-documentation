# **Blacklist**

The blacklist allows you to add players for any reason to a list that keeps track of them. This is your own personal blacklist and is stored in your game directory with other mod files.

It stores their UUID (fallback to username), timestamp of when they were blacklisted, and then what reasons they are blacklisted for.

## Usage

**Blacklisting a player:**

`/blacklist | /bl <player> <reasons>`

_The reasons should be separated by a space, with the exception of "legit scaffold" which will be treated as one reason. If no reason is provided while blacklisting it will fall-back to "cheating" as a generic reason._

**Removing from blacklist:**

`/unblacklist | /ubl <player\>`

**Blacklist info:**

`/blacklist info | /bl info <player\>`

_Will show if that player is in your blacklist, and if so when they got blacklist as well as the blacklist reasons._

!!! Example

    /bl tatp autoblock killaura fakelag

## Icons

Blacklisted players will have an icon in tablist and their nametag, depending on how you configure the [Icons Module](../../../modules/meowtils/icons/).

The blacklist icon color depends on what reasons they are blacklisted for, this is based on priority which means the color will represent the highest severity reason they are blacklisted for.

<span style="color: #aa0000">⚠</span> **= Highest severity blatant cheat reason**

<span style="color: #ffaa00">⚠</span> **= Medium severity closet cheat reason**

<span style="color: #ff55ff">⚠</span> **= Blacklisted & safelisted at the same time**

<span style="color: #00aa00">⚠</span> **= Any other custom reason**

## Alerts

You can enable alerts so if a player that is blacklisted shows up in your world, it will send you a warning.

This can be enabled while using the [PlayerWarning Module](../../../modules/antisnipe/playerwarning/).

## Reasons

These are the pre-defined reasons provided, and their color will follow the severity as shown above. If you are blacklisting for a reason that is not pre-defined it will instead show up as green.
