!!! Note

    Due to how this module works it may not be 100% accurate, additionally it only pings the server once a minute which means temporary lag-spikes may not be shown. 
    
    It is recommended that you use the [LatencyAlerts](/modules/utility/latencyalerts/) module to detect lag-spikes instead.
